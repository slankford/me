      Hello, welcome to this place. I recently graduated from the University of Arkansas
      in May of 2017 with a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics.
      My undergraduate Honors Thesis research involved simulating foodborne pathogens in poultry
      production to generate meaningful data to help defend against intentional contamination.
      <br><br>
      As of June 2017, I work for General Motors as a software developer.
